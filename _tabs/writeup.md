Hello! I'm *Beardenx* (Bear Den), a cybersecurity enthusiast with a focus on Red Teaming. With a background in FinTech and penetration testing, I've grown from a Junior Security Engineer to a key member of the Offensive Team at one of Malaysia's leading investment firms.

I love staying updated in this ever-changing field, that's why I created this site. It's a handy guide for everything related to Offensive Security. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just beginning your journey, I provide invaluable tools and insights to navigate the cybersecurity landscape.

I designed this for my personal growth, but I hope it serves as a valuable resource for you too. Let's dive in and tackle those security challenges together!
