Hello! I'm Beardenx (Bear Den), a cybersecurity enthusiast with a focus on Red Teaming. With a background in FinTech and penetration testing, I've progressed from Junior Security Engineer to a key Offensive Team member at one of Malaysia's leading investment firms.

I love staying updated in this ever-changing field, so I created this playbook. It's a handy guide for everything related to Red Teaming. Whether you're experienced or just starting out, this playbook offers useful tools and information to help you in your cybersecurity journey.

I designed this playbook for personal growth, but I hope it serves as a valuable resource for you too. Let's dive in and tackle those security challenges together!
