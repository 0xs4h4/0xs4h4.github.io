## Scenarios Leading to Privilege Escalation
 
 - Hunting for Local Admin Access: Gain local admin access on other machines.
 - Hunting for High Privilege Domain Accounts: Target accounts like Domain Administrator.
 - Example Scenario : 
    1. I have local admin access on a machine
    2. A Domain Admin has a session on that machine
    3. I steal his token and impersonate him
    4. Profit!

## Methods of Privilege Escalation
 
 - Missing Patches
 - Automated Deployment and AutoLogon password in clear text
 - AlwaysInstallElevated (Any user can run MSI on SYSTEM)
 - Misconfigured Services
 - DLL Hijacking and more
 - NTLM Relaying a.k.a Wontâ€™t Fix
 - NTLM Relaying example - https://github.com/antonioCoco/RemotePotato0
