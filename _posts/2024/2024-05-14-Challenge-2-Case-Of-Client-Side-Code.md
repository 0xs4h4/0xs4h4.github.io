### Challenge/Task

1. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
2. DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### 1. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Proof-of-Concept (POC):**

From previous challenge, we have found a website which is https://the-abstractors.com/. After further checking, there is a signup page that everyone can register as a user.

(/img/cwae/theabstractor.png){: w="400" h="400" }{: .normal }
(/img/cwae/signup.png){: w="400" h="400" }{: .normal }

As a tester, we will play around all the functions/button/form inside the website. There is a page where we can write a post. I try to inject xss script inside all the field. In the Title field, the payload canâ€™t be executed because the <> tag is been encoded
(/img/cwae/xss1.png){: w="400" h="400" }{: .normal }
(/img/cwae/xss2.png){: w="400" h="400" }{: .normal }

However, in content, seems we can execute the payload but the alert is not pop-up. 
(/img/cwae/xss3.png){: w="400" h="400" }{: .normal }
(/img/cwae/xss4.png){: w="400" h="400" }{: .normal }

Upon checking the source code, there is a line to avoid the system from execute the alert and prompt function. 
(/img/cwae/xss5.png){: w="400" h="400" }{: .normal }

We try to use other function which is confirm ()
(/img/cwae/xss6.png){: w="400" h="400" }{: .normal }

XSS found using confirm ()
(/img/cwae/xss7.png){: w="400" h="400" }{: .normal }
